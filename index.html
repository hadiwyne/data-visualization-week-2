          In our previous report, we established criteria to evaluate GlobalShala's social media marketing campaigns. Our analysis identified <b>SHU_Students (Australia)</b> as the least effective campaign, with <b>SHU_Students (UK)</b> as the second worst performer. While both underperform, we suggested optimizing the UK campaign due to its slightly better click-through rate (CTR).

          This week, we will support our recommendation by exploring the dataset and making visualizations to visually depict how the data validates our criteria. We will go through each of the supporting evidence listed in the previous report, and represent it visually. Multiple programs such as Power Bi, Tableau, and R will be used to create these visualizations.

        The deeper shaded bar shows which campaign has the highest CPC out of all. The Australian campaign's CPC is approximately <strong>608% higher</strong> than the average campaign CPC, demonstrating severe cost inefficiency.

        This graph compares the average CPC with the Australian campaignâ€™s CPC. The difference is clearly visible in this graph.

      <p class="caption">
        When benchmarked against our most cost-efficient campaign (Nigeria) which had an average CPC of <strong>$0.34</strong>, the contrast becomes even more dramatic. The Australian campaign requires <strong>$7.58</strong> more per click than the Nigerian campaign ($7.92 vs. $0.34), making it 23 times more expensive to achieve the same basic engagement metric. 
We can also do a campaign efficiency score to see which is the second worst performing campaign, which we had earlier explained to be the UK campaign. This Efficiency scored was achieved via the following formula: 
<br><br><strong>Efficiency Score = Unique Link Clicks (ULC) / Amount Spent</strong>

        We can visually confirm that the Australian campaign has one of the lowest efficiency scores.
