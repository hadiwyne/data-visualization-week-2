          In our previous report, we established criteria to evaluate GlobalShala's social media marketing campaigns. Our analysis identified <b>SHU_Students (Australia)</b> as the least effective campaign, with <b>SHU_Students (UK)</b> as the second worst performer. While both underperform, we suggested optimizing the UK campaign due to its slightly better click-through rate (CTR).
        </div>
        <div id="paragraph-2" class="intro-card green-card">
          This week, we will support our recommendation by exploring the dataset and making visualizations to visually depict how the data validates our criteria. We will go through each of the supporting evidence listed in the previous report, and represent it visually. Multiple programs such as Power Bi, Tableau, and R will be used to create these visualizations.

      <p class="caption">
        The deeper shaded bar shows which campaign has the highest CPC out of all. The Australian campaign's CPC is approximately <strong>608% higher</strong> than the average campaign CPC, demonstrating severe cost inefficiency.
      </p>

    <div class="chart-item">
      <img src="images/w2_avg_cpc_aus_fig2.png" alt="CPC Visualization" class="bar-chart-2">
      <p class="caption">
        This graph compares the average CPC with the Australian campaignâ€™s CPC. The difference is clearly visible in this graph.
      </p>

      <img src="images/w2_cpc_aus_nig_fig3.png" alt="CPC Visualization" class="bar-chart-3">
      <p class="caption">
        When benchmarked against our most cost-efficient campaign (Nigeria) which had an average CPC of <strong>$0.34</strong>, the contrast becomes even more dramatic. The Australian campaign requires <strong>$7.58</strong> more per click than the Nigerian campaign ($7.92 vs. $0.34), making it 23 times more expensive to achieve the same basic engagement metric. 
We can also do a campaign efficiency score to see which is the second worst performing campaign, which we had earlier explained to be the UK campaign. This Efficiency scored was achieved via the following formula: 
<br><br><strong>Efficiency Score = Unique Link Clicks (ULC) / Amount Spent</strong>

        We can visually confirm that the Australian campaign has one of the lowest efficiency scores.

  <h2 id="supoptim-engagement">- Suboptimal Engagement Metrics</h2>

  <div class="charts-container">
    <div class="chart-item">
      <img src="images/w2_ctr_avgline_fig5.png" alt="CTR Visualization" class="bar-chart-5">
      <p class="caption">
        Despite needing premium placement costs, the Australian campaign consistently underdelivers on critical engagement metrics that drive campaign success. The Australian campaign achieves only a 3.3% CTR, which is 21.4% below our portfolio average of 4.2%. This underperformance is particularly problematic considering its position as our highest-cost campaign on a per-click basis.</p>

<div class="chart-item-2">
  <img src="images/campaign_performace_us_uk_aus_fig8.png" alt="Campain Performance" class="bar-chart-6">
  <p class="caption">
    When compared to similar markets (UK and USA), the Australian campaign consistently underperforms. We can clearly see here that the Australian campaign has largely been a financial burden on the client.

  <p class="caption">
    The campaign's reach <b>(14,492 users)</b> also doesn't translate to meaningful engagement. These graphs show the ULC of all other campaigns compared to the Australian campaign, which is one of the lowest.
