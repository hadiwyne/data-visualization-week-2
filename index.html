          In our previous report, we established criteria to evaluate GlobalShala's social media marketing campaigns. Our analysis identified <b>SHU_Students (Australia)</b> as the least effective campaign, with <b>SHU_Students (UK)</b> as the second worst performer. While both underperform, we suggested optimizing the UK campaign due to its slightly better click-through rate (CTR).

          This week, we will support our recommendation by exploring the dataset and making visualizations to visually depict how the data validates our criteria. We will go through each of the supporting evidence listed in the previous report, and represent it visually. Multiple programs such as Power Bi, Tableau, and R will be used to create these visualizations.
